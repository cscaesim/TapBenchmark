# TapBenchmark
A little application to measure reaction time

I just wanted to challenge myself to build an app in a few hours, and this is the result.
There's a few more small things I would like to add, like a history, cleaning up the design some more (not my strongest suite :) ).
Probably mess with a few of the functions, to get the reaction time as realistic as possible.
